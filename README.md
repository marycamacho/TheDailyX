# TheDailyX

This is a tracking app to measure and track important things like water intake, calorie intake,
calories burned, skincare and vitamins. Currently it merely allows a user to click into a box and
create a slash or an X to indicate half or full units. Each day you can reset the app and begin
tracking again. Plans include adding db, ability to modify goals and logging daily wins for each 
goal and tracking streaks.
